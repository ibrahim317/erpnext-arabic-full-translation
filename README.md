## About This Project

This project is dedicated to providing and maintaining high-quality Arabic translations for Frappe and ERPNext. As the official translations can sometimes lag behind or be incomplete, this repository offers a 100% translated alternative.

## Installation & Usage

To apply these Arabic translations to your Frappe/ERPNext instance, you will need to have access to the command line on your server and have the `bench` command-line utility installed.

Follow these steps carefully:

1.  **Download the translation files:**
    You can either clone this repository or download the `.po` files directly.

    ```bash
    git clone [Your GitHub Repository URL]
    ```

2.  **Locate your Frappe and ERPNext app directories:**
    The translation files need to be placed in the correct `locale` directory within each app. The typical paths are:
    * **Frappe:** `frappe-bench/apps/frappe/frappe/locale`
    * **ERPNext:** `frappe-bench/apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale`

3.  **Copy the `.po` files:**
    * Copy the `ar.po` file for Frappe to the `frappe-bench/apps/frappe/frappe/locale/` directory.
    * Copy the `ar.po` file for ERPNext to the `frappe-bench/apps/erpnext/erpnext/locale/` directory.

4.  **Update Translations:**
    Navigate to your `frappe-bench` directory and run the following commands to update the translations in your database:

    ```bash
    cd frappe-bench
    bench build
    ```
    This command compiles assets, including your new translation files.

5.  **Clear Cache and Restart:**
    For the changes to take full effect, clear the cache and restart the bench.

    ```bash
    bench --site all clear-cache
    bench restart
    ```

6.  **Set Language for Users:**
    Each user can set their language to Arabic in their user settings within the ERPNext desk.
